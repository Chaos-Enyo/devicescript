# Adafruit Seesaw

The `@devicescript/seesaw` package provides basic support for Adafruit Seesaw. Adafruit Seesaw is an I2C protocol to communicate with multiple sensors and devices over a single wire.

:::tip

The package is very "base" and is in need of community contributions to add support for the various devices that can be connected to the seesaw.

## Usage

Instantiate the driver

```ts
import { SeesawDriver } from "@devicescript/seesaw"

const seesaw = new SeesawDriver()
```
